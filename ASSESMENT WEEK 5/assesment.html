Queston 1 Difference between Props and State<hr><br>
-Props are used to pass data from one component to another as arguments.And they are immutable. <br> <br>

-State is used to store data in a component.it is mutable within the component <br> 
state is managed within the component <br> <br>
<hr>
Question 2  <hr><br>

a) const c1 =1   ;c1 =3;    console.log(c1);<br>
<b>it will result to a type error <br> 
this is because const is a constant variable and cannot be changed by variable reassignment  </b><br>

b) c2 += "world" ; console.log(c2);<br>
<b>it will result to a type error  <br> 
</b>this is because const is a constant variable and cannot be changed by variable reassignment<br>

c> const c3={} ; c3.name="Geoff" c3.someValue="Sausage" c3={};<br>
<b>it will add the name and someValue to the object c3<br></b>
<b> although it will result to a type error  because of the last statement is an assigment to an object<br><br></b>

 Question 3 React Life Cycles  <hr><br>

<b>Mounting<br></b>
The mounting phase is when a new component is created and inserted into the DOM<br>
This can only happen once, and is often called â€œinitial render.<br><br>

<b>Updating<br></b>

The updating phase is when the component updates or re-renders.<br>
This reaction is triggered when the props are updated or when the state is updated. <br>
This phase can occur multiple times, which is kind of the point of React.<br>
<br><br>



<b>Unmounting<br></b>
It's last phase within a component's lifecycle is the unmounting phase,
when the component is removed from the DOM.<br><br>
<hr>
Question 4 Differece between controlled and uncontrolled components  <hr><br>
<b>
In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component.<br>
 in uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.
</b>

<hr>
Question 5 Explain the three dots in react <hr><br>

<b> they are called the spread operator</b><br>
allows you to deconstruct an array or object into separate variables.<br>
It can also be used to merge multiple arrays or objects into one.<br>
